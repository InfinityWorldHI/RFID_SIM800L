GPRS Shield and Cheap SIM800L PCB BOARDS
===

Only two special functions are different for SIM900 Shield or SIM800L PCB boards:
  - For SIM900 shield you have to use powerUpDown.
  - For SIM800L with RST pin, you have to use powerReset.

GPRS Shield provide you a way to DIY your own **mobile phone**. You can use your GRPS Shield to dial a phone number or send a text message to your friend. Besides these, you can use it to access the network and view web pages. For more information, you can visit our [Wiki Page](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/GPRS_Shield_V3.0/)

[Limitations of SoftwareSerial library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/SoftwareSerial)
===

If using multiple software serial ports, only one can receive data at a time.
Not all pins on the Mega and Mega 2560 support change interrupts, so only the following can be used for RX: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 50, 51, 52, 53, A8 (62), A9 (63), A10 (64), A11 (65), A12 (66), A13 (67), A14 (68), A15 (69).
Not all pins on the Leonardo and Micro support change interrupts, so only the following can be used for RX: 8, 9, 10, 11, 14 (MISO), 15 (SCK), 16 (MOSI).
On Arduino or Genuino 101 the current maximum RX speed is 57600bps
On Arduino or Genuino 101 RX doesn't work on Pin 13
If your project requires simultaneous data flows, see Paul Stoffregen's AltSoftSerial library. AltSoftSerial overcomes a number of other issues with the core SoftwareSerial, but has it's own limitations. Refer to the AltSoftSerial site for more information.

Applications
===
+ Call up and answer Call
+ Send SMS and read SMS
+ AT Command Test
+ TCP Connection Test 
+ Issue HTTP GET requests

Getting Started
===
Make sure that two libraries ([GPRS_Shield](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/GPRS_Shield) —— GPRS Module Library, [SoftwareSerial](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/tree/master/libraries/SoftwareSerial) —— we use software serial to communicate with GPRS module) have been in your libraries folder. Then you can have a test with the sketches in example folder.
+ GPRS_Serial_Debug —— test GPRS module with AT commands.
+ GPRS_CallUp ——  give a call to someone.
+ GPRS_SendSMS —— send a message to someone.
+ GPRS_LoopHandle —— answer the call & read the message.
+ GPRS_SMSread —— another way to read a message. 
+ GPRS_TCPConnection —— build a TCP connection and read the content from the specified website. 
+ GRPS_HTTP_GET —— issue a HTTP GET request using native HTTP support of module
